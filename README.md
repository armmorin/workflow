## üß≠ About This Project

### Real-World Problem

The development of **sustainable energy technologies** like solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and electrolysis cells (SOECs) **faces a major materials challenge**. These devices need solid electrolytes that can effectively transport oxygen ions, but existing materials such as yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) only show high conductivity at temperatures above 800¬∞C. Running at these high temperatures causes material degradation, compatibility issues with other components, and lowers overall energy efficiency. The main issue is the **absence of materials that provide high oxygen-ion conductivity at lower, more practical temperatures around 400‚Äì600¬∞C**.

### Research Motivation

This project was driven by the need to **speed up the discovery of new low-temperature oxygen-ion conducting (OIC) materials**. Recent research has highlighted hexagonal perovskite (HP) structures, such as Ba‚ÇáNb‚ÇÑMoO‚ÇÇ‚ÇÄ, as promising options due to their inherent oxygen vacancies and adaptable crystal structures. However, a thorough exploration of the extensive chemical space within this structural family was lacking. The main goal was to use autonomous, high-throughput computational workflows to efficiently screen thousands of HP compositions, find new candidates, and **understand the atomic-scale mechanisms that control ion migration**.

### Significance of the Work

This work significantly advances the field of energy materials by systematically screening 5,400 hexagonal perovskite compositions through an entirely autonomous DFT-based workflow. It successfully identified **29 unique and promising candidate materials** for low-temperature oxygen-ion conduction, many of which have not yet been synthesized experimentally.

In addition to discovering new materials, the study offers valuable insights into the physics of ion transport. It clearly categorizes oxygen-ion migration into two separate pathways: a straightforward **ion-hopping** mechanism and a more intricate **cooperative migration** mechanism. Importantly, the research shows that the cooperative mechanism, characterized by the collective rotation of flexible polyhedral units, consistently results in lower energy barriers and improved ion mobility. These insights provide a rational framework for guiding future experimental efforts, emphasizing the design of materials that promote these low-energy cooperative pathways.

## üîé Key Insights

- The high-throughput screening effectively reduced a chemical space of 5,400 structures to **29 novel and promising candidate compositions** for low-temperature oxygen-ion conduction.

- Oxygen-ion migration mainly occurs via two mechanisms: a straightforward **ion-hopping** process and a **cooperative mechanism** involving the collective rotation of tetrahedral units.

  - The **cooperative migration** is consistently linked to lower activation barriers because rotating flexible polyhedral units helps minimize high-energy lattice strain during ion transport.

- Analysis using Continuous Symmetry Measures (CSM), the study found a direct link between local coordination, polyhedral distortion, and the migration mechanism, providing a quantitative measure of ionic mobility.

- Key chemical trends that promote the rotational dynamics necessary for the low-energy cooperative mechanism were detected in this study.

## üìù Methodology

This project was executed using a multi-stage, autonomous computational workflow designed to efficiently screen a large materials database for promising oxygen-ion conductors.

- **Dataset and Systems:**  
  
  The study began with a chemical space of 5,400 unique compositions based on the A‚ÇáB‚ÇÑB'O‚ÇÇ‚ÇÄ hexagonal perovskite prototype. All structural data, calculations, and results were stored and managed in a **SQLite3 database**, accessed and manipulated using the **Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE)**
  
- **Workflow Management**  

  The entire high-throughput screening process‚Äîfrom structure generation to final analysis‚Äîwas orchestrated using **PerQueue**, a dynamic Python-based workflow manager. PerQueue enabled the automation of thousands of parallel calculations on high-performance computing (HPC) clusters, managing dependencies, and dynamically filtering candidates based on calculated properties.

- **Calculation Process:**  

  First-principles calculations were performed using **Density Functional Theory (DFT)** as implemented in the VASP code. The workflow consisted of several filtering steps:
  
    1.  **Initial Screening:** Structures were filtered based on chemical and geometric rules (e.g., charge neutrality, ionic radii).
    2.  **Stability Analysis:** Thermodynamic stability was assessed by calculating the energy above the convex hull (E_hull < 100 meV/atom).
    3.  **Electronic Properties**: A bandgap filter (> 1.0 eV) was applied to select for electronically insulating materials.
    4.  **Kinetic Analysis:** For the remaining candidates, the **Nudged Elastic Band (NEB)** method was used to calculate the oxygen-ion migration energy barrier (E_A < 1.1 eV)

-  **Analytical Tools**

  Continuous Symmetry Measure (CSM) analysis was employed to quantify the distortion of the coordination polyhedra around the migrating ion at each step of the NEB path. This allowed for the classification of migration mechanisms and provided a direct link between atomic structure and ionic mobility.

## ü§î Interpretation

This screening project's results strongly indicate that tailoring the local geometry and dynamic flexibility of the crystal lattice is more effective for improving ionic conductivity than merely adjusting composition. The main insight is that materials supporting cooperative migration‚Äîwhere polyhedral units rotate to facilitate ion movement‚Äîperform better. This offers a clear design principle for experimentalists: prioritize compositions with flexible tetrahedral units and ample free volume to enable these low-energy rotational modes.

Additionally, this research confirms the value of autonomous high-throughput workflows as essential tools in modern materials discovery. By automating complex, repetitive computational screening tasks, we can navigate extensive chemical spaces and identify fundamental structure-property relationships that would be difficult to uncover with traditional experimental or computational approaches.
